  <Title>Span, Memory and Pipelines, the APIs you always missed</Title>
  <Description>The new Span&lt;T&gt; and Memory&lt;T&gt; are a new set of APIs offering the ability to dramatically lower memory copies obtaining native-like performance while still coding safely. An interesting bonus is the support for unsafe pointers and memory manipulation that voids the need of native languages in many scenarios.

In addition to that, the Pipelines and Buffers APIs, created to boost the ASP.NET Core performances, provides a very powerful replacement of stream-based processing with the minimum possible overhead.

During the session we will see all of those APIs in action, understanding how they works and when they should be adopted.</Description>
