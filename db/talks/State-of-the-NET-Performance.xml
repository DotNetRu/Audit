  <Title>State of the .NET Performance</Title>
  <Description>In this talk Adam will describe how latest changes in.NET are affecting performance.
Adam wants to go through:
C# 7: ref locals and ref returns, ValueTuples.
.NET Core: Spans, Buffers, ValueTasks

And how all of these things help build zero-copy streams aka Channels/Pipelines which are going to be a game changer in the next year.</Description>
